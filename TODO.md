# TODO

Features I have in mind and would like to implement before releasing AppwriteCMS 1.0:

- Sort by attribute functionality
- Multiselect delete in list
- Array in list, somehow
- Relationship components
- Dashboard components (graphs, ...)
- Dark theme
- Responsibity
- Write GitBook docs
- Auth using email&password (custom cloud function)
- Offset pagination option
- Research cursor pagination (probably never before direction)
- TODOS in code
- Better relation system allowing relation on ANY component
