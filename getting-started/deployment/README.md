This section would love some more work! No one is perfect and we don't know all web hostings our there. If you managed to deploy AppwriteCMS to your favourite hosting and it is not on this list, please consider updating this page for developers in the future. This project has been given to you for free and this might be the best way for you to give back to the open source community.
