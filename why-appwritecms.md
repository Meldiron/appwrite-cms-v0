# ðŸ¤” Why AppwriteCMS?

AppwriteCMS was created to fill the missing spot of the CMS market. After research, I found out there isn't any low-code solution that would let developers rapidly prepare CMS that can use Appwrite as a source of the data.

In no way is AppwriteCMS trying to replace Directus, Strapi or Netlify CMS. All of these are really cool projects and I would highly recommend all of them to anyone who cares about their CMS. With that said, AppwriteCMS is the only one that as of writing this documentation supports Appwrite backend.

To provide a quick summary of Appwrite features, you can check our comparison table of AppwriteCMS and Directus (we compare to Directus because have experience with it).To show our transparency and support the fact we are not trying to degrade any other solution, we also showed some features that we don't support ðŸ˜‰
